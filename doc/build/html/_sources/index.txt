MASSef documentation
=========================

MASSef is an hybrid mathematica and python package based on the MASS toolbox [add link] to build enzyme-level kinetic models.

The key idea is to, given an enzyme mechanism and kinetic data, such as kcats and Kms, to fit the enzyme model to the data. 

This documentation is intended to give both an overview of the package and a detailed description of each function.
