MASSef documentation
=========================
.. _here: https://github.com/opencobra/MASS-Toolbox/releases

MASSef is an hybrid mathematica and python package based on the MASS toolbox (here_) to build enzyme-level kinetic models.

The key idea is to fit microscopic rate constants for a given enzyme mechanism to macroscopic kinetic data such as kcats and Kms. 

This documentation is intended to give both an overview of the package and a detailed description of each function.
